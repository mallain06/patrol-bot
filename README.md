# Patrol Bot

A Discord bot for managing daily patrol scheduling, AOP (Area of Patrol) voting, attendance tracking, and statistics for roleplay communities.

## Features

- **Daily Patrol Voting** — Members vote for a patrol start time each morning. Votes close at 6:30 PM EST with a minimum attendance threshold.
- **AOP Voting** — Members vote on the patrol area. Supports Liberty City (LC) and Los Santos (LS) map sets, switchable by admins.
- **Persistent Session State** — Votes, messages, and voting status survive bot restarts via SQLite persistence. Buttons remain functional after a restart.
- **Briefing Reminder** — Automatically pings 10 minutes before the confirmed patrol start time to join the briefing voice chat.
- **Cancel Announcements** — Cancelling a patrol notifies the announcement channel and edits any existing announcement.
- **Smart Map Switching** — Changing the map while AOP voting is open resets votes and refreshes buttons automatically.
- **Duplicate Vote Protection** — Changing your vote doesn't inflate stat counters; only the first vote is tracked.
- **Command Autocomplete** — Time slots and area names are suggested as you type in slash commands.
- **Biweekly Stats Leaderboard** — Posts a ranked leaderboard to the stats channel every 14 days.
- **Inactivity Tracking** — Automatically detects members who haven't responded in 2 weeks and posts reports.
- **Welcome & Goodbye Messages** — Automatically sends styled welcome messages (with rules and resources links) to new members, and goodbye messages when members leave.
- **Admin Commands** — Cancel patrols, override start times/AOP, view per-user and server-wide statistics.

## How It Works

1. **8:00 AM EST** — The bot automatically posts patrol and AOP votes with interactive buttons.
2. Members click buttons to vote for a start time or mark "Can't Make It", and vote for an AOP area.
3. **6:30 PM EST** — Voting closes automatically. If minimum attendance is met, the patrol is confirmed and an announcement is posted. Otherwise, it's cancelled.
4. **10 minutes before patrol** — A briefing reminder is sent to the briefing channel.
5. Admins can override times/AOP, cancel, or force-start patrols at any time.
